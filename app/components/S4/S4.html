                    Here’s another way to find out what you value. I’d like you to reflect for just a moment upon that one person in your life - a grandparent, parent, close friend, or, perhaps, a mentor - who always seems to make the right decision, no matter how much pressure that person is under. Someone whose behavior you have tried to emulate when you’ve found yourself under difficult circumstances. How would you describe this person? What words come to mind that characterize this person to whom you look up? Chances are this person reflects your own beliefs and values. Or, at least what you would like them to be. Most often, when I ask that question of audiences, I hear words like: balanced, controlled, confident, compassionate, caring, flexible, energized, calm, and peaceful.<br><br>
Do those sound like the words on your list? If these are the common characteristics of people you admire, then they are probably the characteristics that you most value and desire to have yourself. You can become that person. And the first important step is experiencing that realization of what you want to be. Let’s look closely at that list again.<br><br>
Balanced. These are people who don’t just talk the talk; they walk the walk. They have a good balance of work and family time. They eat well and exercise. They relax and play. They are involved in their communities. They have plenty of social interaction, yet they take the time to reflect and allow time for themselves. They live a balanced life. Most importantly, they conduct their lives in a manner that is consistent with their beliefs and value system. They don’t deviate. Their value system is like an old friend, a constant that keeps them centered, even during the most severe stress.<br><br>
Controlled. These are people who are in control. But, by control, I do not mean the ability to manipulate or to control other people. Instead, they are in control of their own emotions, and, as a result of not allowing anger, fear, or sadness interfere with their objectives, they are able to remain focused. A values-driven belief provides a foundation for their lives.<br><br>
Confident. They are people who are able to do things with seemingly very little effort and, as a consequence, they are, indeed, confident. In addition, they are able to instill confidence in others, which is why people often gravitate towards them.<br><br>
Compassionate and Caring. They are individuals who often engage in altruistic pursuits. They believe in the inherent good of all people. They do not prejudge others.<br><br>
Flexible and Energized. These are people who are active physically as well as mentally. They are open-minded people who gather as much information as they can so that their perception of the world is realistic.<br><br>
Calm and Peaceful. They have core beliefs that match their system of living. Their way of life reflects what they believe. They are in their optimal emotional state - that condition when the emotion they feel and express will help propel them towards a worthwhile goal. They are healthy, working and living to their fullest potential. They also have maximum functional capacity right up until the end.<br><br>
What prevents you from accessing this optimal emotional state? First, think of the times you have been able to access this state. Everything seems to flow easily; your thinking is clearer, you perform better, and you accomplish more; you are relaxed, and you feel good about yourself and what you are doing. Maybe it happened once on the golf course – one of those days where you just couldn’t miss. Or the time you gave a presentation and pulled it off flawlessly. Or, wrote a paper effortlessly. Or, put together that new intergalactic spacecraft with your six- year-old. You hardly needed directions. Remember those times when you weren’t anxious or frustrated. You were balanced, controlled, confident, compassionate, caring, flexible, energized, calm, and peaceful.<br><br>
What stops you from accessing this state more often? What prevents you from acquiring those qualities you most admire in your favorite person? An erroneous belief? Here are some of the most common I’ve heard, which, invariably, are not justified and impede progress towards a goal.<br><br>

                            <li>I never do well on exams.</li>
                            <li>There’s nothing I can do about it. It runs in my family.</li>
                            <li>Failure is bad; I must always succeed.</li>
                            <li>Stress is bad, and it should be avoided.</li>
                            <li>I’m too old to change.</li>
                            <li>I’m no good at relationships.</li>
                            <li>Nice guys finish last.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>

                <p>Any of these sound familiar? Then accept the Belief Challenge, and, if warranted, change your belief.<br><br>
Some beliefs may be very difficult to change – especially when they are cultural, as many are. Look at your workplace culture. Do you believe you have to work a tremendous amount of over- time to get ahead? Do you believe that if you tell colleagues you are taking off early to see your daughter in a play or to go out with your husband to celebrate your wedding anniversary, they won’t take you seriously? I know workplaces where it’s considered a badge of courage not to take a vacation. People are proud of having stored up 100 or more vacation days. Some people display million mile tags on their airline baggage. To me, it says the time they spend on their work is out of proportion with time spent with family, with community, and with self. And I know they are not nearly as productive as they think they are.<br><br>They are driven by some of the common beliefs of their culture, instead of their own value system. For just a moment, project your mind in space and time to the future. I know this is a bit morbid, but when you are lying on your deathbed, in your hour of final reflection, do you think that you’re going to wish that you’d spent more time at the office, or more time with your family?<br><br>
Let’s now consider advertised beliefs and the concept of balance. Picture this. There’s a guy with his family in front of a sculpture at the Whitney Museum, and he takes out his cell phone to check in with work. Cut to a new scene: there’s a woman having lunch with her mother at a lovely restaurant, but she has her notebook computer on the table, checking her e-mail. Almost all advertisements surrounding technology want you to believe that you can have more downtime because you can be connected with work while you relax. This is a contradiction. You need to unplug, unwind, and just relax when you relax. Enjoy nothing else but the art in the museum when you are there, sharing the experience with your family. And don’t miss out on the great conversation over lunch with your mom. Be where you are. That’s an important part of living a centered life. When your life is in balance, your access to the optimal emotional state is easy and effortless.</p>
