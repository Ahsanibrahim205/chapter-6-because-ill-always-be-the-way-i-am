                        <p>Now that you have identified your beliefs and your value system, what do you want to do with them? What do you want out of life? Many people live their entire life without ever asking this question, and, as a consequence, they fail to extract from life all that they might have had. A childhood prayer concludes: …if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. A sad thought. Just as sad would be the substitution of the words: ...if I should die before I live. Too many people drift aimlessly through life without a clear understanding of what they truly want. They eventually die at a ripe, old age, but they die before they have lived. More than likely, they never had any meaningful goals. Don’t let this happen to you. Identify your personal goals now. Complete these statements, and do so on a regular basis, so that you don’t forget.<br><br>
                            In my lifetime, I want to ____________.<br><br>
Prior to retirement, I want to ____________.<br><br>
Before my children have left home, I want to ____________.<br><br>
By _________________, I want to _________________.<br><br><br><strong>
Now ask yourself these questions:</strong>

                        <div class="text-content">

                                <ul>
 <li>Are these goals attainable?<li>
                                        <li>Are they my goals or those of someone else?<li>
                                        <li>Are they stated concisely and as a positive objective?<li>
                                        <li>Am I willing to begin now? If not, under what circumstances will I begin?<li>
                                        <li>Am I willing to make changes in my life to achieve my goals?<li>
                                        <li>Are my goals consistent with my values and beliefs?<li>
                                        <li>Do any of my goals conflict with each other?<li>
                                        <li>What am I willing to give up to achieve my goals?<li>

                        <p>Establishing unrealistic goals is a sure way to doom you to failure. It’s important to set goals for yourself. It’s your life. Do what feels right for you, not what you think is expected of you by associates or by family members. You also must make a commitment to achieve your goals. Many people get involved in various projects that they believe will help them reach their objective, but they fail to get there because they don’t make a commitment. True commitment means making sacrifices and delaying gratification. Establishing unrealistic goals is an effort in futility. And identifying goals that are inconsistent with your values and beliefs will be a constant source of conflict.</p>
