                <p>Who are you? When you introduce yourself to someone and have to give a one or two sentence explanation of who you are, how do you answer? Like this?</p>
                <br>
                <p>“Hi. I’m Nick Hall, Director of Important Stuff at the XYZ Corporation.”<br>
                    <br>
Is your identity attached to your work? If so, you might have too much of your self-esteem, of who you are as a person, tied to the workplace. If one day you awaken, and you are not Nick Hall, Director of Important Stuff at the XYZ Corporation, who would you be? What would you be if you lost your job tomorrow - and I’m not talking about the financial implications? If you lost your job tomorrow, how would you define yourself? You could no longer say, “I’m Director of Important Stuff.” You could no longer say, “I work at the XYZ Corporation.” Are you a daughter, a brother, a mother, a son? Are you a sailor, a gardener, a seamstress, a wood worker, an artist? Your personal identity will, in turn, shape your values, beliefs, and goals, which will impact on the progress you make toward a goal. If your beliefs are enabling you to make progress toward achieving your goals, I suspect the emotions you experience are largely positive and fulfilling. But, if your beliefs are keeping you from achieving your goals, you probably are experiencing many negative emotions. And, if you don’t know what your beliefs or goals are, then you probably bounce from one emotional state to another without knowing why.<br>

Why is it that some people live life so passionately and so fully? They work at jobs they love. They enjoy their family. They have mastered the art of pleasure, and they are rich in every aspect of their lives because they are living to their fullest potential. Could it be as simple as the fact that their system for living truly reflects their core beliefs and values? I think so.</p>
